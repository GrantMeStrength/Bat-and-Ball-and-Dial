# Bat and Ball (and Dial)

A simple UWP app written using MonoGame, that demonstrates a pong-like game using the Microsoft Dial as a controller.

The app detects the size of the screen, and adapts the display accordingly. A Microsoft Dial is supported, but you can also use the keyboard. Press Space and use the Cursor Left/Right keys!
